# GiftTax
A gift is a transfer of property to another person against no compensation or payment. If the total value of the gifts you receive from the same donor in the course of 3 years is â‚¬5,000 or more, you must pay gift tax.  Write a program that calculates the gift tax for a gift from a close relative or a family member.
